# 57 Exercises for Programmers

These are exercises that I have done based on the book:
"57 Exercises for Programmers" by Brian P. Hogan

Each exercise has different added challenges which I will do once the right chapter has been finished. This means that I may go back to exercises I have already done and create a more advance form of code for it.

These exercises can be done in any code, but I am using Python 3.6.
